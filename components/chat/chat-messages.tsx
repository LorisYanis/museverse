        Whispers of the Wind
        
        In the twilight of the day,
        Where the sun and moon hold sway,
        Whispers of the wind unfold,
        Stories ancient, yet untold.

        Leaves, they dance in silent glee,
        Choreography of the tree.
        Secrets woven in the breeze,
        Natureâ€™s gentle expertise.

        Mountains standing tall and wise,
        Painted by the sunset skies.
        Rivers carving paths below,
        Whispers in the currents flow.

        Stars emerge, a cosmic choir,
        Lighting up the night entire.
        In the quiet, hear the call,
        Nature's poem, written for all.

        So, in the hush of eventide,
        Let your thoughts and dreams collide.
        In the whispers of the night,
        Find the magic, pure and bright.`}
